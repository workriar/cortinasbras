# Walkthrough: PDF Generation and Email Integration

## Changes Made
- **Added `puppeteer` dependency** and imported it in [src/services/pdf.ts](file:///root/next-app/src/services/pdf.ts).
- **Created [generatePdf(html)](file:///root/next-app/src/services/pdf.ts#83-91)** function using Puppeteer for HTML‑to‑PDF conversion.
- **Extended existing PDF service** ([generateOrcamentoPdf](file:///root/next-app/src/services/pdf.ts#6-82)) remains unchanged.
- **Created API route** [src/pages/api/generate-pdf.ts](file:///root/next-app/src/pages/api/generate-pdf.ts) that generates the PDF from lead data and sends it via email.
- **Added email service** [src/services/email.ts](file:///root/next-app/src/services/email.ts) with Nodemailer transporter and [sendEmailWithPdf](file:///root/next-app/src/services/email.ts#13-49) / generic [sendEmail](file:///root/next-app/src/services/email.ts#49-64) functions.
- **Inserted generate PDF button** into [src/components/Hero.tsx](file:///root/next-app/src/components/Hero.tsx) with loading state and handler [handleGeneratePdf](file:///root/next-app/src/components/Hero.tsx#25-53).
- **Installed required packages** (`puppeteer`, `nodemailer` already present).
- **Verified API endpoint** via `curl` – response `{ "message": "PDF generated and email sent" }`.

## Verification Steps
1. Ran `npm run dev` and ensured the dev server started on port 3002.
2. Executed a POST request to `/api/generate-pdf` with sample lead data – received success message.
3. UI button appears in Hero component; clicking it triggers the same API call (manual UI testing can be performed by the user).

## Next Steps (optional)
- Test the button in a real browser to confirm UI flow.
- Adjust email templates or SMTP credentials as needed.
- Add unit/integration tests for the new API route.
